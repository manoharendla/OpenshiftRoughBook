# Automate the procedure of adding github external and internal username and password details in jenkins credentials.

There are two options to automate the credentials addition in Jenkins.

*First option:* To store password in plain text in credentials.xml, copy it over to jenkins machine after installing and starting the service. Then jenkins will encrypt it with it's new secret  and it will work
*Second option:*  A second option is to install jenkins, start it and then copy the credentials.xml with encrypted passwords together with secrets directory and secret.xml from previous instllation. This will copy both encryption master key and the encrypted credentials that have been created using this master key.


Copy the credentials.xml file, secrets directory and secrets.xml from working pod to local.
